### Detailed Solutions for Each Question:

### **Question One**

#### (a) (i). **Obtain the Inverse Fourier Transform of G(w), H(w), and X(w):**
The signals given are:

1. G(w) = five divided by open bracket j w minus two closed bracket
2. H(w) = twelve divided by open bracket w squared plus four closed bracket
3. X(w) = ten divided by open bracket open bracket j w minus one closed bracket multiplied by open bracket j w minus two closed bracket closed bracket

---

1. **For G(w):**  
   - Expression: G(w) = five divided by open bracket j w minus two closed bracket
   - The form of G(w) matches that of a shifted impulse function in Fourier Transform. Using the standard Fourier Transform rule, one can determine the time-domain representation:
     \( F(jw) = \frac{A}{jw - a} \) transforms to \( f(t) = A \cdot e^{a \cdot t} \) for \( t \geq 0 \).

     So:
     - Here, A = five, and a = two.
     - The inverse Fourier Transform of this function is: 

       **g(t) = five multiplied by e raised to the power two t, for t greater than or equal to zero.**

---

2. **For H(w):**  
   - Expression: H(w) = twelve divided by open bracket w squared plus four closed bracket
   - The form of H(w) matches that of the Fourier Transform of a cosine function. Using the property \( F(w) = \frac{A}{w^2 + \omega_0^2} \), it transforms to \( f(t) = A \cdot \cos(\omega_0 t) \).

     So:
     - Here, \( A = six \) (since twelve divided by two gives six), and \( \omega_0 = two \).
     - The inverse Fourier Transform of this function is: 

       **h(t) = six multiplied by cosine of two t.**

---

3. **For X(w):**  
   - Expression: X(w) = ten divided by open bracket open bracket j w minus one closed bracket multiplied by open bracket j w minus two closed bracket closed bracket
   - This is a product of two terms in the frequency domain, corresponding to a partial fraction decomposition in the time domain.

     Rewrite X(w):  
     \( X(w) = \frac{A}{jw - 1} + \frac{B}{jw - 2} \)

     Solving for A and B using partial fraction decomposition:
     \( A (jw - 2) + B (jw - 1) = 10 \)

     Substitute values of w to solve:
     - When \( jw = 1 \), \( A = 10 \).
     - When \( jw = 2 \), \( B = -10 \).

     Then:
     \( X(w) = \frac{10}{jw - 1} - \frac{10}{jw - 2} \)

     Now take the inverse Fourier Transform of each term:
     - \( \frac{10}{jw - 1} \) becomes \( 10 e^{t}, t > 0 \)
     - \( -\frac{10}{jw - 2} \) becomes \( -10 e^{2t}, t > 0 \)

     Final result:  
     **x(t) = ten multiplied by e raised to the power t minus ten multiplied by e raised to the power two t, for t greater than or equal to zero.**

#### (a) (ii). **Why do we study Laplace Transform?**

The Laplace Transform is studied for several reasons, including:

1. **Simplification of Differential Equations:** It converts complex differential equations into simpler algebraic equations, which are easier to solve.
2. **Analysis of Systems:** It is extensively used in analyzing linear time-invariant systems, especially in control and signal processing.
3. **Initial and Final Value Theorems:** It provides powerful tools such as the initial value and final value theorems, allowing us to analyze system behavior at the start and end of processes.
4. **Handling of Discontinuous Inputs:** Laplace Transform is particularly useful for systems with piecewise or discontinuous inputs, as it allows these to be efficiently processed.

#### (b) **Realizing the Transfer Function and Finding L and C**

The transfer function given is:  
"V two divided by V one equals two s divided by s squared plus two s plus six."  

**Steps:**

1. **Generalize the Circuit:**  
   The circuit comprises a resistor \( R \), an inductor \( L \), and a capacitor \( C \). The transfer function is given by:

   \( V two divided by V one = \frac{s \times C \times R}{1 + s \times C \times R + s^2 \times L \times C} \)

   Compare this with the transfer function: \( \frac{2s}{s^2 + 2s + 6} \).

2. **Compare Terms:**  
   - From the numerator: \( C \times R = 2 \), so \( C = \frac{2}{R} \). \( R = 1 k \Omega = 1000 \, \Omega \). Thus:

     \( C = \frac{2}{1000} = 0.002 \, F = 2 \, mF \).

   - From the denominator: \( L \times C = 6 \). Substitute \( C = 0.002 \):

     \( L = \frac{6}{C} = \frac{6}{0.002} = 3000 \, H = 3 \, H. \)

**Final Values:**  
- Inductance \( L = 3 \, H \)  
- Capacitance \( C = 2 \, mF \)

### **Question Two**

#### (a) **Brief Explanation of Network Synthesis**

Network synthesis refers to designing and constructing a physical network (using resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) that meets a desired transfer function or impedance specification. The goal is to derive a physical and realizable network from mathematical representations or requirements.

---

#### (b) **Find the Node Voltages in Figure 2**

The circuit contains multiple resistors, a DC voltage source, a current source, and dependent sources, requiring node voltage analysis.

Define the reference node \( V_0 = 0 \). Let the voltages at the nodes be \( V_1 \), \( V_2 \), etc. Apply Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) to each node.

(Solution to be continued step-by-step…)

---

### **Question Three**

#### (a) **Conditions Necessary for Network Stability**

The conditions for a network to be stable are:

1. **BIBO Stability:** The system must be bounded-input, bounded-output stable. This means any bounded input should yield a bounded output.
2. **Poles of the Transfer Function:** All poles of the transfer function must lie in the left-half of the complex plane for continuous-time systems.
3. **Causality:** The network must be causal to ensure responses occur only after inputs are applied.
