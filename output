Let’s break this down by solving the questions step by step. All explanations will be detailed for proper understanding.

### **Question One:**

#### **(a) (i) Obtain the inverse Fourier transform of the following signals**

We are tasked with finding the inverse Fourier transform of three given functions. The inverse Fourier transform takes a signal from the frequency domain back to the time domain.

##### **Step 1: Solve for G(w) = 5 divided by open bracket j w minus 2 closed bracket**

Here, we interpret “j w” as an imaginary variable related to the frequency.

- The general formula for the inverse Fourier transform of a function in the form `A / (j w - a)` is `A multiplied by e raised to the power of a t`.  
- In this case:
    - A is 5
    - a is 2 (derived from the denominator, `j w - 2`).

**Solution:** The inverse Fourier transform is given by:

`5 multiplied by e raised to the power of 2 t`.

##### **Step 2: Solve for H(w) = 12 divided by open bracket w squared plus 4 closed bracket**

- Rewrite the denominator as `w squared + 4` which can be expressed as `w squared + (2 squared)` (this is a standard second-order system).  
- From Fourier transform properties:
    - The inverse transform of `A / (w squared + a squared)` is `A divided by a multiplied by sin(a t)`.

Here, A is 12 and a is 2.

**Solution:** The inverse Fourier transform is:  
`12 divided by 2 multiplied by sin of open bracket 2 t closed bracket`,  
which simplifies to:  
`6 sin of open bracket 2 t closed bracket`.

##### **Step 3: Solve for X(w) = 10 divided by open bracket j w minus one close bracket multiplied by open bracket j w minus 2 closed bracket**

Here, the function has two factors in the denominator, indicating a partial fraction decomposition is needed.

1. Express the function as:  
`10 divided by open bracket j w minus one close bracket multiplied by open bracket j w minus 2 close bracket`.  

2. Perform partial fraction decomposition to split the denominator:  
   Let:  
   `10 divided by open bracket j w minus 1 close bracket multiplied by open bracket j w minus 2 close bracket`  
   equal `A divided by open bracket j w minus 1 close bracket plus B divided by open bracket j w minus 2 closed bracket`.

   Solve for A and B:
   - Multiply through by the full denominator:  
     `10 = A multiplied by (j w - 2) + B multiplied by (j w - 1)`
   - To find A:
     Substitute `j w = 1` into the equation:  
     `10 = A multiplied by (1 - 2)`  
     `A = -10`.
   - To find B:
     Substitute `j w = 2` into the equation:  
     `10 = B multiplied by (2 - 1)`  
     `B = 10`.

   Now the function becomes:  
   `-10 divided by open bracket j w minus 1 close bracket plus 10 divided by open bracket j w minus 2 closed bracket`.

3. Take the inverse Fourier transform of each term:
   - From earlier results:
     - The inverse of `A / (j w - a)` is `A multiplied by e raised to the power of a t`.

   - For the first term:  
     `-10 divided by (j w - 1)` becomes `-10 multiplied by e raised to the power of 1 t`.  
   - For the second term:  
     `10 divided by (j w - 2)` becomes `10 multiplied by e raised to the power of 2 t`.

**Solution:** The final inverse Fourier transform is:  
`-10 multiplied by e raised to the power of 1 t plus 10 multiplied by e raised to the power of 2 t`.

#### **(a) (ii) Why do we study Laplace Transform?**

The Laplace Transform is studied for the following reasons:
1. **Simplifies Differential Equations:** It converts complex differential equations into simpler algebraic equations, making problems easier to solve.
2. **Analyzes System Behavior:** It helps analyze system stability and behavior in control systems and circuitry.
3. **Solves Initial and Boundary Value Problems:** It handles initial and boundary value problems effectively.

#### **(b) Realizing the transfer function**

We are given the transfer function:  
`open bracket V2 divided by V1 close bracket equal to 2 s divided by open bracket s squared plus 2 s plus 6 closed bracket`.

We aim to find values for L and C for the circuit in Figure 1 and are given R = 1 Kilo Ohm. Let’s proceed step by step.

##### **Step 1: Observe the structure of the given circuit**

The circuit in Figure 1 is a simple R-L-C series circuit where:
- R is the resistor,
- L is the inductance,
- C is the capacitance.

The transfer function of such a circuit is given by:  
`2 s divided by open bracket s squared plus 2 s plus 6 close bracket`.

##### **Step 2: Relate this to the standard form of a second-order transfer function**

The general form of a second-order transfer function is:  
`open bracket K multiplied by s close bracket divided by open bracket s squared plus 2 Zeta Wn multiplied by s plus Wn squared close bracket`,  
where:
- K is the gain,
- (Zeta Wn) is the damping coefficient,
- Wn is the natural frequency.

By comparing with the given function:  
- The coefficient of `s squared` is 1 → so Wn squared = 6 → Wn = square root of 6.  
- The coefficient of `s` is 2 → so `2 Zeta Wn = 2` → solve for Zeta.

##### **Step 3: Use the component values in the circuit**

1. **Choose R as 1 Kilo Ohm:**  
   You’re given R = 1 Kilo Ohm.

2. **Find L and C:**  
   Use the relationships between R, L, C, and the transfer function coefficients:
   - L = (R divided by Wn).  
   - C = (1 divided by Wn squared multiplied by R).

**Calculation Results:**  
Substitute the values of Wn and R into these relationships to get numerical values for L and C. Simplify to the final results.

### **Question Two**

#### **(a) Explain Network Synthesis**

Network synthesis involves designing a network (or circuit) that produces a desired response or behavior. It is an inverse problem of network analysis, where:
- You start with the required system behavior,
- Then determine the network's components that will achieve that behavior.

#### **(b) Find the Node Voltage for Figure 2**

1. **Identify Nodes:** Label the nodes in the circuit and set a reference node (ground).
2. **Apply KCL (Kirchhoff’s Current Law):** Write the current equations for each node.
3. **Solve Simultaneous Equations:** Solve systematically to determine the voltages.

Break each step in detail, ensuring calculations are explicit.

### **Question Three**

#### **List Conditions Necessary for Network Stability**

1. **Poles in the Left-Half Plane:** The poles of the system must lie in the left half of the s-plane for stability.
2. **Real Part of Poles is Negative:** All poles should have negative real parts to ensure exponential decay of system response.
