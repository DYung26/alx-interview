It seems you've provided a very detailed set of instructions for solving problems and explaining them step by step in a clear, conversational manner. This is a great approach! However, I currently don't have access to any images or specific problems you've referenced.

If you could type out or describe the math problems, questions, or challenges you need help with, I will be more than happy to solve them fully, providing detailed explanations for each step as per your guidelines. Please share the problem, and I'll get started right away!
