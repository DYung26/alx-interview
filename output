### **Question One (a)**  
#### Part (i): Obtain the inverse Fourier transform of the given signals.  
We are given three signals:  

1. **G of omega equals five divided by open bracket j omega minus two closed bracket**  
   - To find the inverse Fourier transform, recognize that the given term resembles the standard Fourier transform property of an exponential function:  
     - If F(omega) = C divided by open bracket j omega minus a closed bracket, then the inverse Fourier transform is C multiplied by exponential of open bracket a t closed bracket multiplied by u of t, where u of t is the unit step function.  
   - Here, comparing with the formula:  
     - C equals five, a equals two.  
     - The inverse Fourier transform would be:  
       **five multiplied by exponential of open bracket two t closed bracket multiplied by u of t.**

2. **H of omega equals twelve divided by open bracket omega squared plus four closed bracket**  
   - Rewrite the denominator: omega squared plus four as omega squared plus two squared.
   - Recall the Fourier transform property for a time-domain sinc function:  
     - If F(omega) = C divided by open bracket omega squared plus a squared closed bracket, the inverse Fourier transform is:  
       C divided by two a multiplied by exponential of negative a multiplied by absolute value of t closed bracket.  
   - Here, C equals twelve and a equals two. Using the formula, the inverse Fourier transform becomes:  
     **twelve divided by four multiplied by exponential of open bracket negative two absolute value of t closed bracket**, which simplifies to **three multiplied by exponential of negative two absolute value of t.**

3. **X of omega equals ten divided by open bracket j omega minus one closed bracket multiplied by open bracket j omega minus two closed bracket**  
   - This expression involves two poles (at j omega equals one and j omega equals two). We perform partial fraction decomposition to simplify this further:  
     Write: ten divided by open bracket j omega minus one closed bracket multiplied by open bracket j omega minus two closed bracket as:  
     A divided by open bracket j omega minus one closed bracket plus B divided by open bracket j omega minus two closed bracket,  
     where A and B are constants to be determined.  
   - Multiply through by the denominator to obtain:  
     ten equals A multiplied by open bracket j omega minus two closed bracket plus B multiplied by open bracket j omega minus one closed bracket.  
   - Let j omega equal one:  
     ten equals A multiplied by open bracket one minus two closed bracket. This gives A equals negative ten.  
   - Let j omega equal two:  
     ten equals B multiplied by open bracket two minus one closed bracket. This gives B equals ten.  
   - Thus, the expression becomes:  
     negative ten divided by open bracket j omega minus one closed bracket plus ten divided by open bracket j omega minus two closed bracket.  
   - The inverse Fourier transform becomes:  
     **negative ten multiplied by exponential of t multiplied by u of t, plus ten multiplied by exponential of two t multiplied by u of t.**

#### Part (ii): Why do we study Laplace Transform?  
- The Laplace Transform is studied because:  
  1. It simplifies the analysis of linear time-invariant systems by converting differential equations into algebraic equations.  
  2. It helps to analyze the transient and steady-state behavior of systems.  
  3. It is useful for solving initial value problems in control systems and circuit theory.

### **Question One (b)**  
We are to realize the transfer function:  
**V two divided by V one equals two s divided by open bracket s squared plus two s plus six closed bracket**  

#### Given data:  
- R equals one kilo ohm, or one thousand ohms.  
- We are to find L and C.  

#### Step 1: Recall the structure of the transfer function for the given circuit (Figure 1).  
- The transfer function is derived from the impedance of the resistor, inductor (L), and capacitor (C) in the circuit.  
- For a series RLC circuit:  
  The transfer function is given by:  
  **V two divided by V one equals one divided by open bracket L multiplied by C closed bracket open bracket s squared plus open bracket R divided by L closed bracket multiplied by s plus open bracket one divided by L multiplied by C closed bracket closed bracket.**

#### Step 2: Compare coefficients of the transfer function.  
- The given transfer function is two s divided by open bracket s squared plus two s plus six closed bracket.  
- Matching it with the standard transfer function form:  
  - Coefficient of s squared corresponds to one.  
  - Coefficient of s corresponds to open bracket R divided by L closed bracket.  
  - Constant term corresponds to open bracket one divided by L multiplied by C closed bracket.  

#### Step 3: Solve for L and C.  
1. From the coefficient of s squared:
   - It corresponds to one, so this gives no additional information as it is normalized.  

2. From the coefficient of s:  
   - Coefficient is two, which equals R divided by L.  
   - Substitute R equals one thousand:  
     two equals one thousand divided by L.  
     Solve for L: L equals one thousand divided by two equals five hundred henries.

3. From the constant term:  
   - Constant term is six, which equals one divided by L multiplied by C.  
   - Substitute L equals five hundred:  
     six equals one divided by five hundred multiplied by C.  
     Solve for C: C equals one divided by open bracket five hundred multiplied by six closed bracket equals one divided by three thousand equals zero point zero zero zero three three farads, or thirty-three microfarads.  

**Final Answer:**  
- L equals five hundred henries.  
- C equals thirty-three microfarads.
