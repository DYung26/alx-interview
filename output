I will provide step-by-step solutions to the questions based on the given assignment and provide detailed explanations for each part.

### **Question One (a):**
#### (i) Obtain the inverse Fourier transform of the following signals:
1. \( G(w) = (5) divided by (j w minus 2) \)  
2. \( H(w) = (12) divided by (w squared plus 4) \)  
3. \( X(w) = (10) divided by (open bracket (j w minus 1) (j w minus 2) close bracket) \)  

Let us solve each part step by step.

---

#### **Solution for the first part:**
1. \( G(w) = (5) divided by (j w minus 2) \).  
We recall the **inverse Fourier transform formula**:  
The inverse Fourier transform of \( (A) divided by (j w minus a) \) is equal to:
\[ A multiplied by (e) raised to the power of (a t) multiplied by U(t), \]  
where \( U(t) \) is the **unit step function**.

Here, \( A = 5 \) and \( a = 2 \):
\[ G(t) = (5) multiplied by (e) raised to the power of (2 t) multiplied by U(t). \]

So, the final solution is:
\( G(t) = 5 multiplied by exponential of (2 t) multiplied by U(t). \)

---

#### **Solution for the second part:**
2. \( H(w) = (12) divided by (w squared plus 4) \).  
We recall that the Fourier transform of \( (b) divided by (w squared plus a squared) \) is equal to:
\[ b divided by (2 a) multiplied by exponential of minus (a) times the absolute value of t. \]  

In this problem, \( b = 12 \) and \( a squared = 4 \). From \( a squared = 4 \), \( a = 2 \).  

Thus, \( H(t) = (12 divided by (2 multiplied by 2)) multiplied by exponential of minus (2 times the absolute value of t). \)  

Simplifying:
\[ H(t) = 3 multiplied by exponential of minus (2 times the absolute value of t). \]

So, the final solution is:
\( H(t) = 3 multiplied by exponential of minus (2 times the absolute value of t). \)

---

#### **Solution for the third part:**
3. \( X(w) = 10 divided by ((j w minus 1) (j w minus 2)) \).  
To find the inverse Fourier transform, we break this into **partial fractions**.  

Write \( X(w) \) as:
\[ X(w) = A divided by (j w minus 1) plus B divided by (j w minus 2), \]  
where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants to be determined.  

Multiply through by the denominator \( (j w minus 1)(j w minus 2) \):
\[ 10 = A multiplied by (j w minus 2) plus B multiplied by (j w minus 1). \]  

Expanding:
\[ 10 = A multiplied by (j w) minus 2 A plus B multiplied by (j w) minus B. \]  

Grouping terms:
\[ 10 = (A plus B) multiplied by (j w) minus (2 A plus B). \]  

Equating coefficients of \( j w \):
\[ A plus B = 0. \]  

Equating constants:
\[ minus (2 A plus B) = 10. \]  

From \( A plus B = 0 \), we get \( B = minus A \). Substitute into the second equation:
\[ minus (2 A plus (minus A)) = 10. \]  
\[ minus (2 A minus A) = 10. \]  
\[ minus A = 10. \]  
\[ A = minus 10. \]  

Thus, \( B = minus A = 10. \)  

So, the partial fraction decomposition is:
\[ X(w) = (minus 10) divided by (j w minus 1) plus (10) divided by (j w minus 2). \]  

Now, compute the inverse Fourier transform of each term:
- The inverse Fourier transform of \( (minus 10) divided by (j w minus 1) \) is:
  \( minus 10 multiplied by exponential of (1 t) multiplied by U(t). \)  

- The inverse Fourier transform of \( (10) divided by (j w minus 2) \) is:
  \( 10 multiplied by exponential of (2 t) multiplied by U(t). \)  

Thus, combining the results:
\[ X(t) = minus 10 multiplied by exponential of (t) multiplied by U(t) plus 10 multiplied by exponential of (2 t) multiplied by U(t). \]

#### **(ii) Why do we study Laplace Transform?**
The Laplace transform is useful because:
1. It simplifies the analysis of systems, especially in engineering, by converting differential equations into algebraic equations.
2. It is helpful for solving linear time-invariant systems, such as circuits or mechanical systems.
3. It can handle initial conditions easily, unlike Fourier Transform, which does not capture transient behaviors effectively.

### **Question One (b):**
#### It is desired to realize the transfer function \( V_2(s) divided by V_1(s) = (2 s) divided by (s squared plus 2 s plus 6) \) using the circuit in Figure 1. Choose \( R = 1 \) k Ohm and find \( L \) and \( C \).

The transfer function given is:
\[ V_2(s) divided by V_1(s) = (2 s) divided by (s squared plus 2 s plus 6). \]  

---

#### **Step 1: Compare with the standard form for an RLC circuit.**
For the RLC series-parallel circuit in Figure 1, the transfer function is given by:
\[ V_2(s) divided by V_1(s) = (s divided by (L)) divided by [(s squared plus (R divided by L) s plus (1 divided by (L multiplied by C))]. \]  

From the problem:
- The numerator is \( (2 multiplied by s) divided by (...). \) Hence, \( R divided by L = 2. \)  
- Constant term in the denominator: \( (1 divided by (L multiplied by C)) = 6. \)  

---

#### **Step 2: Solve for \( L \).**
From \( R divided by L = 2 \), substitute \( R = 1 \) k Ohm \( = 1000 Ohms \):
\[ 1000 divided by L = 2. \]  
\[ L = 1000 divided by 2. \]  
\[ L = 500 Henrys. \]  

---

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( C \).**
From \( 1 divided by (L multiplied by C) = 6 \), substitute \( L = 500 Henrys \):
\[ 1 divided by (500 multiplied by C) = 6. \]  
\[ C = 1 divided by (500 multiplied by 6). \]  
\[ C = 1 divided by 3000. \]  
\[ C = 0.000333 Farads or 333 microFarads. \]  

---

#### **Final Answer for Question One (b):**
- \( R = 1 \) k Ohm \( = 1000 Ohms \).  
- \( L = 500 Henrys. \)  
- \( C = 333 \) microFarads.

### **Question Two:**
#### (a) Briefly explain Network Synthesis.
Network synthesis is the process of designing a network or electrical circuit that satisfies a given impedance or transfer function. The goal is to determine the component values (resistors, capacitors, and inductors) that will produce the desired performance. It is commonly used in filter design and signal processing to meet specifications such as frequency response.

---

#### (b) Solve the circuit in Figure 2.
To solve for the node voltage, we apply **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)** at each major node.  

(Detailed solutions will follow step-wise, depending on the specific image processing). 

(Comment and clarify which parts of Figure 2 you want detailed). 

--- 

### **Question Three:**
#### List the conditions necessary for network stability.
The necessary conditions for network stability include:
1. **Poles of the system**: All poles of the transfer function must lie in the left-half of the complex plane (negative real part).
2. **Bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability**: For every bounded input, the output must also be bounded.
