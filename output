### Image 1 Solutions:

**QUESTION 1:**

#### Part (a): For the circuit shown in Figure 1, find "v b of t," given that "v b at time zero equals three volts."

**Explanation of Figure 1:**  
- The circuit contains a capacitor of one Farad in parallel with a ten Ohm resistor. The input voltage source is labeled as "ten e raised to the power of negative four t volts."  
- The capacitor initially has a voltage of three volts across it at time equals zero.  

**Analysis and Solution:**  
The output voltage is "v b," which will be determined using the natural response and the forced response of the capacitor and the resistor.

1. **Step 1 - Recall the relationship for a first-order RC circuit:**  
   The voltage across the capacitor in an RC circuit is given by:  
   "v of t equals v final plus open bracket v initial minus v final close bracket times e raised to the power of negative t divided by RC."  

2. **Step 2 - Capturing initial conditions:**  
   - The resistor value is ten Ohms.  
   - The capacitor value is one Farad.  
   - The initial voltage on the capacitor is three volts.  
   - The driving source is ten e raised to the power of negative four t.  

3. **Step 3 - Identify time constant and final behavior:**  
   - The time constant "tau" is given by "R times C," which is "ten times one equals ten seconds."  
   - The final voltage across the capacitor will match the voltage of the source since capacitors act as open circuits in steady state. Then, as time approaches infinity, "v final equals zero volts" because "ten e raised to the power of negative four t" approaches zero.

4. **Step 4 - Write the full solution:**  
   Substitute these values:
   "v b of t equals v final plus open bracket v initial minus v final close bracket times e raised to the power of negative t divided by tau."

   This becomes:
   "v b of t equals zero plus open bracket three minus zero close bracket times e raised to the power of negative t divided by ten."  

   Simplify:
   "v b of t equals three times e raised to the power of negative zero point one times t volts."  

**Final Result:**  
The voltage "v b of t" is "three e raised to the power of negative zero point one t volts."

#### Part (b): What is the condition necessary for a function "lower case f of t," to have a Laplace transform?

**Solution:**  
For a function to have a Laplace transform, it must satisfy the following condition:

1. The function **must be piecewise continuous** or discontinuous at a finite number of points.  
2. The function **must be exponential-order**, meaning there exists a positive constant "K" and a real number "a," such that the absolute value of "lower case f of t" is less than or equal to "K times e raised to the power of a times t" for time t greater than or equal to zero.  

**Final Result:**  
The two necessary conditions are:  
- The function **is piecewise continuous.**  
- The function **is of exponential order.**

**QUESTION 2:**

For the circuit shown in Figure 2:

#### Part (i): Determine the transfer function "H of s equals V two divided by V one."

**Explanation of Figure 2:**  
- This circuit has an input voltage source "V one" applied across the series combination of a resistor "R two," and a capacitor with capacitance "C."
- The voltage "V two" is measured across the capacitor.  

**Analysis and Solution:**  

1. **Step 1 - Recall impedance of a capacitor in the Laplace domain:**  
   The impedance of a capacitor "Z c" is given as "one divided by s C," where "s" is the Laplace variable.

2. **Step 2 - Express total impedance:**  
   The total impedance of the circuit is the sum of "R two" and "one divided by s C." This is:  
   "Z total equals R two plus open bracket one divided by s C close bracket."

3. **Step 3 - Apply voltage divider rule:**  
   The voltage across the capacitor "V two" is given by:
   "V two equals V one times open bracket Z c divided by Z total close bracket."

   Substitute expressions for "Z c" and "Z total":
   "V two equals V one times open bracket open bracket one divided by s C close bracket divided by open bracket R two plus open bracket one divided by s C close bracket close bracket close bracket."  

4. **Step 4 - Simplify:**  
   Multiply numerator and denominator by "s C" to eliminate fractions:  
   "H of s equals V two divided by V one equals one divided by open bracket s C R two plus one close bracket."

**Final Result:**  
The transfer function is "H of s equals one divided by open bracket s C R two plus one close bracket."

#### Part (ii): Determine "H of s equals one divided by open bracket s divided by one hundred plus one close bracket."

**Solution:**  
Here, we are provided with a transfer function of the form one divided by open bracket s divided by one hundred plus one close bracket. This is already simplified. No derivation is required beyond rewriting the given transfer function as:  
"H of s equals one divided by open bracket s divided by one hundred plus one close bracket."

**QUESTION 4:**

#### Part (a): Applying the frequency differentiation property of Laplace transform, find "b of t."

Frequency differentiation property states: In the Laplace domain, the derivative of a time-domain function with respect to time is represented as multiplication by "s" in Laplace.

Using this property and being given a specific function "F of s," we can calculate "b of t."
